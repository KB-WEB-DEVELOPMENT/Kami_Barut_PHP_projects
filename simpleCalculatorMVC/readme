This is a simple PHP application based on the MVC (Model - View - Controller) programing structure.

It was programed  by I. Castro (copyrights) for Xenframework (www.xenframework.com)

The user is asked to select one of the arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/) and enter two digits.

The result of the operation is displayed underneath. 

The code is not really clean as some methods in CalculatorController.php could be merged with others in the same conroller.

It was successfully tested.
